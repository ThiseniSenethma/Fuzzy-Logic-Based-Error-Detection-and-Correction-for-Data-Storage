# Fuzzy Logic-Based Error Detection and Correction for Data Storage

This fuzzy logic was created to enhance the reliability of storage solutions.
<br>
It consists of fuzzy logic to detect and mitigate errors in stored data.
<br>
It uses Data Redundancy rate, Storage degradation rate and Historical error rate as inputs and output the Error Likelihood.
<br>
User is prompted with a text field to input the rates. Those inputs are then used to output the error likelihood. 
<br>
To increase the accuracy and reliability 27 rules are applied to represent as many possibilities as possible. 
<br>
The decisions are made considering those set of rules and a output is given in a graphical way. It also does defuzzification to output the crisp values.
